### Stack

#### What is a Stack?

Stack is a one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations,
namely **push** and **pop**.

**push** - put one element into the top.

**pop** - remove the top from the top.

#### When and where is a stack used ?
* Used by undo mechanisms in text editors.
* Used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces.
* Can be used to model a pile of books or plates.
* Used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls.
* Can be used to do Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.

#### Complexity

| Pushing       | O(1) |
|---------------|------|
| **Popping**   | O(1) |
| **Searching** | O(n) |
| **Size**      | O(1) |
